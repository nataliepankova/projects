The budget_calc.py does this kind of stuff:

- you give it the name of category, initial deposit and spendings --> it gives you a receipt like this:

```
*************Food*************
initial deposit        1000.00
groceries               -10.15
restaurant and more foo -15.89
Transfer to Clothing    -50.00
Total: 923.96
```

- it can also provide you with a histogram showing percentage of deposit spent by category, like this:
```
Percentage spent by category
100|
