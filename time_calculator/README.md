This function takes 2 arguments - current time (12-hour format) like '1:03 AM' and time to be added to the current one like '3:25' or '205:50'. Optionally, the third argument - day of week - can be added.

As a result, it returns new time in 12-hour format (and day of week if was given) + informs you how many days will be passed since the starter time (if more than 24 hours was added).
